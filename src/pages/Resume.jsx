EXPERIENCE
Belcan Engineering Group, Provo UT November,
2006 to present
 Managed team of 6 engineers:
o Supervised the creation of CAD models &amp; GD&amp;T drawings from legacy manufacturing drawings
o Established a method whereby team members could work on a 30 sheet drawing in parallel, reduced
completion time from 4 weeks to 2 weeks
 Created family of parts for aerospace customer (Pratt &amp; Whitney) using parametric (dynamic)
modeling in NX including:
o
o Turbine blades
o Stators
o Fan rotors
o Integrated blade rotors

 Converted CAD library of 10,000+ parts and assemblies from ProE to NX for laser light source
customer (Cymer)
 Developed custom automation tools for NX and Teamcenter
o Created drawing export tool saving Belcan 1000 man-hours per year
o Developed de-featuring tool, reduced time to prepare CAD models for meshing from weeks to hours
 Designed cooling system for semiconductor customer (ASML) which helps maintain the air
temperature within ± 0.3° C for a machine used to make integrated chips
 Designed rail cart for Aerospace customer (Pratt &amp; Whitney) that is now used to transport and install
HPW3000 turbine engines in the test rig
