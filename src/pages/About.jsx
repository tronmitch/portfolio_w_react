      <p>
        I Studied Mechanical Engineering at BYU.  
        After graduation I spent ten years working at Belcan Engineering.
        I worked on CAD automation tools for clients such as Pratt & Whitney and GE.
        I've spent the last 5 years working for CDSvisual devloping 3d visulations of our clients products.
        I currently live in Orem Utah with my wife and 4 children. When I have the time I love to play most sports, but ultimate frisbee is my all-time favorite.
